    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a small application to manage ships that will allow
    the user to perform <b>CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete)</b> operations on a ship.
    Each ship must have a <b>name</b> (string), <b>length</b> (in meters), <b>width</b> (in meters),
    and <b>code</b> (a string with a format of AAAA-1111-A1 where A is any character
    from the Latin alphabet and 1 is a number from 0 to 9).
    <br><br>
    The project has been created using the <b>.Net Core Web API</b>
    (Dependency Injection — Auto Mapper — Repository Pattern – Entity Framework In-Memory),
    <b>Angular 10+</b> as frontend, and <b>Docker</b> as a deployment platform.
